<h1>Mr. H's Homepage</h1>
<p>Mr. H likes making dinosaur noises and teaching people about web design. Mr. H dislikes volcanos and people wearing headphones in class. Actually, he dislikes rudeness in general, not just the headphone thing. And nothing is more rude than a volcano.</p>

<ol id='assignment'>
<li>Create a file called 'custom.html' in your main folder. Use this <em>exact</em> name and location.</li>
<li>Mark up the basic HTML elements, including a title. If you want, use dummy text to fill out your page:</li>
<p class='hyperlink'><a href='http://lipsum.org'>Lorem Ipsum Generator</a></p>
<li>Style the page attractively, but use PHP to incorporate values from the URL in key ways such as background-color and font.</li>
<li>Check your work using the test page:</li>
<p class='hyperlink'><a href='/'>Check Your Assignment</a></p>
<li>In the second half of class, allow users of your page to enter their styling preferences using forms.</li>
	
</ol>

<!-- <div id='windows'>
<p>If you want to work from home on a Windows computer (Dell, HP, et cetera), Mr. H has typed up some helpful directions.</p>
<p class='hyperlink'><a href='windows.html'>How to use WinSCP</a></p>
</div> -->

<p>Mr. H and Fritz are here to teach you web design, but if you have a question, remember to first ask a neighbor, and then try looking it up on w3schools, before raising your hand.</p>

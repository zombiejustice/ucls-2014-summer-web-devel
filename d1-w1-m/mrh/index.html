<h1>Mr. H's Homepage</h1>
<p>Mr. H likes making dinosaur noises and teaching people about web design. Mr. H dislikes volcanos and people wearing headphones in class. Actually, he dislikes rudeness in general, not just the headphone thing. And nothing is more rude than a volcano.</p>

<ol id='assignment'>
<li>Create a file called 'garden.css' in your Sites folder.</li>
<li>Take a look at the source of our CSS Garden, of which this will be the stylesheet.</li>
<li>Make it very pretty!</li>
<li>Check your work here:<p class='hyperlink'><a href='../garden.php'>CSS Garden</a></p></li>
	
</ol>


<p>Mr. H and Fritz are here to teach you web design, but if you have a question, remember to first ask a neighbor, and then try looking it up on w3schools, before raising your hand.</p>

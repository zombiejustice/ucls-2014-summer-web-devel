This class was designed for students who have had previous knowledge of html and css. It ran for fifteen days, three weeks M-F, in the summer of 2013 at the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools. It was developed by Ian W. Huisken with contributions and assistance from Maddie Lindsey. It was wicked fun.

Notes on structure: As lessons progress, the folders should contain only such files as have changed or are new. Static files, such as the Mr H. homepage, will only be presented once. All files /should/ be relative to the server web root directory.

It was updated for 2014, with assistance by Fritz Reece.
